There are currently 76 wheels on-orbit, all working well.<br><br>All of these reaction wheels incorporate a built-in digital processor. They can be commanded over a serial bus to produce a desired speed, momentum or torque. They report digital telemetry concerning speed, temperature, voltage, current, and other health parameters.","product_url":"https://satsearch.co/products/sinclair-interplanetary-rw-0-01","supplier_url":"https://satsearch.co/suppliers/sinclair-interplanetary","attributes":[{"product_configuration":"base","product_subcomponent":null,"value":"120","minimum_value":"","maximum_value":"","measurement_unit":"g","description":"","class":{"uuid":"119f1c0b-25c7-4cf8-91a6-4014f4a8b598","name":"mass","value_type":"float","description":"","allowed_measurement_units":["kg","g","mg","lb"]}},{"product_configuration":"base","product_subcomponent":null,"value":"I2C","minimum_value":"","maximum_value":"","measurement_unit":"","description":"Given in datsheet as 'Command/Telemetry'.
