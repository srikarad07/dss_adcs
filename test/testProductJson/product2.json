It includes both a reaction wheel, and an optional solid-state angular rate sensor, both of which are operated locally by an embedded microcontroller. The microcontroller implements local speed and torque control loops for the reaction wheel, allowing the reaction wheel to accurately track speed or torque commands from a satellite's attitude control computer. Commands as well as telemetry (e.g., measured wheel speed, momentum, acceleration, torque, rate sensor measurements, temperatures, voltages, internal pressure, etc.) are communicated via a serial interface.","product_url":"https://satsearch.co/products/microsat-systems-canada-micro-wheel-4000","supplier_url":"https://satsearch.co/suppliers/microsat-systems-canada","attributes":[{"product_configuration":"base","product_subcomponent":null,"value":"7","minimum_value":"","maximum_value":"","measurement_unit":"yr","description":"Design life","class":{"uuid":"9d54034c-ae7b-429d-a768-d35d7cb89f31","name":"lifetime","value_type":"float","description":"Operational design life of a device.","allowed_measurement_units":["s","min","hr","dy","wk","yr"]}},{"product_configuration":"base","product_subcomponent":null,"value":"300","minimum_value":"","maximum_value":"","measurement_unit":"mN m","description":"Given in datasheet as 'Torque Capability (at 28V)' and the specified value is assumed from 'Up to 300 mNm @ lower speed'.","class":{"uuid":"a992c4ca-7889-464f-a3b5-f5bba4d7a26e","name":"maximum torque","value_type":"float","description":"Maximum torque that can be delivered by an actuator.","allowed_measurement_units":["mN cm","N cm","mN m","N m"]}},{"product_configuration":"base","product_subcomponent":null,"value":"50","minimum_value":"","maximum_value":"","measurement_unit":"mN m","description":"Given in datasheet as 'Torque Capability (at 28V)' and the specified value is assumed from 'Nominal 50 mNm @ full speed'.","class":{"uuid":"d76db887-202d-4f71-8f53-59ef6cb159ab","name":"torque","value_type":"float","description":"Torque that can be delivered by an actuator.","allowed_measurement_units":["µN cm","mN cm","N cm","µN m","mN m","N m"]}},{"product_configuration":"base","product_subcomponent":null,"value":"4.0","minimum_value":"","maximum_value":"","measurement_unit":"N m s","description":"Given in the datasheet as 'Angular Momentum Capacity.'","class":{"uuid":"1f8bf2f8-ff20-4f47-ab19-2732a83be1de","name":"angular momentum storage","value_type":"float","description":"Total momentum that can be stored by a flywheel.","allowed_measurement_units":["N m s","mN m s"]}},{"product_configuration":"base","product_subcomponent":null,"value":"","minimum_value":"-30","maximum_value":"60","measurement_unit":"C","description":"","class":{"uuid":"ff35d52b-2cf7-43cb-b324-9f41b5f50371","name":"operating temperature","value_type":"float","description":"Operating temperature of device.","allowed_measurement_units":["C","F","K"]}},{"product_configuration":"base","product_subcomponent":null,"value":"RS422/485","minimum_value":"","maximum_value":"","measurement_unit":"","description":"Given in datasheet as 'Asynchronous RS-422/485 serial port'.","class":{"uuid":"01cc5efb-eed0-4c20-b1dd-b768e1431d32","name":"data interface","value_type":"string","description":"Data interface for electronics system.","allowed_measurement_units":[]}},{"product_configuration":"base","product_subcomponent":null,"value":"","minimum_value":"-35","maximum_value":"65","measurement_unit":"C","description":"","class":{"uuid":"ae2a02da-beda-47b1-97ec-317cc672bc99","name":"survival temperature","value_type":"float","description":"Survival temperature for device.","allowed_measurement_units":["C","F","K"]}},{"product_configuration":"base","product_subcomponent":null,"value":"","minimum_value":"","maximum_value":"2.5","measurement_unit":"W","description":"Given in datasheet as 'Power Consumption (at 25C)'.
